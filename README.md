# MP-RAD-Dataset-ITS
MP-RAD Dataset for the paper, "Detection of Road Accidents using Synthetically Generated Multi-Perspective Accident Videos", published in IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, 2022.

## Description
Road accidents are often caused by short abnormal events, including traffic violations, abrupt change in vehicular motion, driver fatigue, etc. Observing an accident event from the proper camera perspective plays a crucial role in detecting accidents. However, capturing such abnormal events from a limited camera perspective may not be possible. We present a deep learning framework to analyze the accident events recorded from multiple perspectives. First, we estimate feature similarity in videos recorded from multiple perspectives. We then divided the video samples into high and low-feature similarity groups. Next, we extract spatio-temporal features from each group using two-branch DCNNs and fuse them using a rank-based weighted average pooling strategy followed by classification. We present a new road accident video dataset (MP-RAD), where each accident event is synthetically generated and captured from five independent camera perspectives using a computer gaming platform.
